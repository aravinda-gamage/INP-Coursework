<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Play Tech Pvt Ltd. is a company that supplies various types of gaming equipment. This company has a
customer support division that assists customers regarding the Play Tech equipment.
Customer support can be a boring and stressful task. Sameera, who is an employee in the customer
support section of Play Tech decide to make things a bit lively by designing a Customized Chat for the
employees of Play Tech Pvt Ltd.
He wanted this chat room to be exclusive to the employees of the Play Tech customer service division,
where they can chat freely as a group and express themselves using emojis or images. Later on, he
decided to add Unicode to the chat group since some employees are used to typing in Sinhala when
they chat.</p>
